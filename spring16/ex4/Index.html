<div class="instructions">
	<h2>Instructions:</h2>
	<ol>
    	<li>First make the ganache. In a microwave safe bowl add the chocolate and coconut milk (or heavy cream). Microwave on high for 30 second intervals, stirring between each until melted. Once melted stir in the vanilla extract. Cover and place in the fridge.</li>
    	<li>Grease 6 (4 ounce) ramekins or 4 (6 ounce ramekins) and place on a baking sheet.</li>
    	<li>Heat the chocolate and butter together on low in a small saucepan, stirring until just melted. Watch it closely to make sure it does not burn. Remove from the heat and stir in the flour and salt until smooth.</li>
    	<li>Add the eggs to a large mixing bowl. Using an electric mixer beat the eggs and slowly add the sugar until the eggs are pale in color, about four minutes. Add the vanilla extract and food coloring, mix until combined. Pour in the melted chocolate mixture and 						            use a rubber spatula or wooden spoon to fold the chocolate into the eggs until just combined. Divide the mixture among the prepared ramekins.</li>
    	<li>Now grab your ganache from the fridge and spoon about 1-2 heaping teaspoons of ganache (you will not use it all) right into the center of the ramekins. Use a spoon to scoop the red velvet mixture over the ganache. Cover the ramekins and place in the fridge               for 15 minutes.</li>
    	<li>Meanwhile preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. After 15 minutes remove from the fridge and place in the oven. Bake for 10-20 minutes (10 minutes for 4 ounce ramekins and 18 minutes for 6 ounce ramekins). Loosen the edges of the cakes with a butter knife and                turn out onto plates. Serve immediately with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream. I also added some toasted coconut, shaved chocolate and pomegranate arils.</li>
